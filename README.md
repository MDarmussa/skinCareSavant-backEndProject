Description:

      SkincareSavant is a back-end static responsive app that recommends the user a skincare product after completing a three question quiz. After completing the quiz, the app will assign the user their skin type (dry, normal, or oily) and recommend them three different skincare products based on their specific skin need. 

      In order to complete the quiz, the user must register and login. To register, the form needs to be filled with the 
	users information(name, email, username, password), and the login must contain the username and password.

      After loging in, the user will be in his/her secure profile to do complete their skin test. We have developed auth security 
	for the user to keep their quiz result and recommendeded products in their profile. In this protected route, the users will not
	be able to see other users data.

     Once the products are recommended, the user can make a comments or provide a review on the product they were recommended.  Once the comment is made, it is saved in ourdatabase and will appear on the page for other users to see. 



Goal:

- Collect questions from users to help them identify their skin type
- Rendering  products for users. These products will have the name, brand, image, and ingredients
- Save user data in their profile
